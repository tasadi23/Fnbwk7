# Week 7 – My Start in the Advanced Phase: Learning Python 🐍

Welcome to **Week 7** of App Academy — the start of the **Advanced Stage** of my journey!

Things are definitely heating up. This week, I’m starting completely from scratch again. I'm stepping away from the comfort zone of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and beginning something totally new: **Python Development**.

## 🚀 What I'm Learning

This week marks the biggest step up so far. I’m learning an entirely new programming language — **Python** — from the ground up.

Even though Python's syntax and structure are different from JavaScript, I’ve already noticed that many of the core concepts are very familiar. Thanks to everything I’ve learned up to this point, I’m picking it up quickly and confidently.

Here's what makes this week so important for me:

- **New language** – I’m learning how to think and code in Python.
- **Fast pace** – I'm building a solid foundation in Python in just three weeks.
- **Real growth** – This is a challenge, but one I’m ready for.

## 💡 Staying Motivated

I won’t lie — learning a new language this quickly isn’t easy. But I know I’m not doing it alone.

I have:
- Support from the App Academy team
- A community of fellow students learning with me
- Everything I’ve already learned pushing me forward

I’m taking it one step at a time, staying curious, and trusting the process. I’m excited (and maybe a little nervous), but most of all, I’m ready.

Let’s go — Python, here I come! 🔥🐍
